#### Relationships

- A TrivyImageFinding affects an ECRImage.

    ```
    (TrivyImageFinding)-[AFFECTS]->(ECRImage)
    ```

- A TrivyImageFinding affects a GCPArtifactRegistryContainerImage.

    ```
    (TrivyImageFinding)-[AFFECTS]->(GCPArtifactRegistryContainerImage)
    ```

- A TrivyImageFinding affects a GCPArtifactRegistryPlatformImage.

    ```
    (TrivyImageFinding)-[AFFECTS]->(GCPArtifactRegistryPlatformImage)
    ```

    ```

### Package
Representation of a package installed in a container image.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| firstseen | Timestamp of when a sync job first discovered this node |
| lastupdated | Timestamp of the last time the node was updated |
| **id** | Unique identifier for the package (format: version|name) |
| installed_version | Version of the installed package |
| name | Name of the package |
| version | Version of the package (same as installed_version) |

    ```
    (Package)-[DEPLOYED]->(ECRImage)
    ```

- A Package is deployed in a GCPArtifactRegistryContainerImage.

    ```
    (Package)-[DEPLOYED]->(GCPArtifactRegistryContainerImage)
    ```

- A Package is deployed in a GCPArtifactRegistryPlatformImage.

    ```
    (Package)-[DEPLOYED]->(GCPArtifactRegistryPlatformImage)
    ```

- A Package is deployed in a GitLabContainerImage.

    ```
    (Package)-[DEPLOYED]->(GitLabContainerImage)
    ```

- A Package is affected by a TrivyImageFinding.

    ```
    (Package)<-[AFFECTS]-(TrivyImageFinding)
    ```

### TrivyFix
Representation of a fix for a vulnerability.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| firstseen | Timestamp of when a sync job first discovered this node |
| lastupdated | Timestamp of the last time the node was updated |
| **id** | Unique identifier for the fix (format: version|name) |
| version | Version that fixes the vulnerability |

| type | Type of the fix |

#### Relationships

- A Package should update to a TrivyFix.

    ```
    (Package)-[SHOULD_UPDATE_TO]->(TrivyFix)
    ```

- A TrivyFix applies to a TrivyImageFinding.

    ```
    (TrivyFix)-[APPLIES_TO]->(TrivyImageFinding)
    ```
