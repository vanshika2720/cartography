### GitLabOrganization

Representation of a GitLab top-level group (organization). In GitLab, organizations are typically the root-level groups that contain projects and nested subgroups.

| Field | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| firstseen | Timestamp of when a sync job first created this node |
| lastupdated | Timestamp of the last time the node was updated |
| **id** | The web URL of the GitLab organization/group |
| **name** | Name of the organization |
| **path** | URL path slug |
| **full_path** | Full path including all parent groups |
| description | Description of the organization |
| visibility | Visibility level (private, internal, public) |
| parent_id | Parent group ID (null for top-level organizations) |
| created_at | GitLab timestamp from when the organization was created |

#### Relationships

- GitLabOrganizations contain GitLabGroups (nested subgroups).

    ```
    (GitLabOrganization)-[RESOURCE]->(GitLabGroup)
    ```

- GitLabOrganizations contain GitLabProjects.

    ```
    (GitLabOrganization)-[RESOURCE]->(GitLabProject)
    ```

- GitLabUsers can be members of GitLabOrganizations with different access levels.

    ```
    (GitLabUser)-[MEMBER_OF{role, access_level}]->(GitLabOrganization)
    ```

    The `role` property can be: owner, maintainer, developer, reporter, guest.
    The `access_level` property corresponds to GitLab's numeric levels: 50, 40, 30, 20, 10.

### GitLabGroup

Representation of a GitLab nested subgroup. Groups can contain other groups (creating a hierarchy) and projects.

| Field | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| firstseen | Timestamp of when a sync job first created this node |
| lastupdated | Timestamp of the last time the node was updated |
| **id** | The web URL of the GitLab group |
| **name** | Name of the group |
| **path** | URL path slug |
| **full_path** | Full path including all parent groups |
| description | Description of the group |
| visibility | Visibility level (private, internal, public) |
| parent_id | Parent group ID |
| created_at | GitLab timestamp from when the group was created |

#### Relationships

- GitLabGroups are resources under GitLabOrganizations.

    ```
    (GitLabOrganization)-[RESOURCE]->(GitLabGroup)
    ```

- GitLabGroups can be members of parent GitLabGroups (nested structure).

    ```
    (GitLabGroup)-[MEMBER_OF]->(GitLabGroup)
    ```

- GitLabProjects can be members of GitLabGroups.

    ```
    (GitLabProject)-[MEMBER_OF]->(GitLabGroup)
    ```

- GitLabUsers can be members of GitLabGroups with different access levels.

    ```
    (GitLabUser)-[MEMBER_OF{role, access_level}]->(GitLabGroup)
    ```

### GitLabProject:GitLabRepository

Representation of a GitLab project (repository). Projects are GitLab's equivalent of repositories and can belong to organizations or groups. The `GitLabRepository` label is included for backwards compatibility with existing queries.

| Field | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| firstseen | Timestamp of when a sync job first created this node |
| lastupdated | Timestamp of the last time the node was updated |
| **id** | The web URL of the GitLab project |
| **name** | Name of the project |
| **path** | URL path slug |
| **path_with_namespace** | Full path including namespace |
| description | Description of the project |
| visibility | Visibility level (private, internal, public) |
| default_branch | Default branch name (e.g., main, master) |
| archived | Whether the project is archived |
| created_at | GitLab timestamp from when the project was created |
| last_activity_at | GitLab timestamp of last activity |
| languages | JSON string containing detected programming languages and their percentages (e.g., `{"Python": 65.5, "JavaScript": 34.5}`) |

#### Sample Language Queries

Get all unique languages used across your GitLab estate:

```cypher
MATCH (p:GitLabProject)
WHERE p.languages IS NOT NULL
WITH p, apoc.convert.fromJsonMap(p.languages) AS langs
UNWIND keys(langs) AS language
RETURN DISTINCT language
ORDER BY language
```

Find all projects using a specific language (e.g., Python):

```cypher
MATCH (p:GitLabProject)
WHERE p.languages CONTAINS '"Python"'
RETURN p.name, p.languages
```

Get language distribution with project counts:

```cypher
MATCH (p:GitLabProject)
WHERE p.languages IS NOT NULL
WITH p, apoc.convert.fromJsonMap(p.languages) AS langs
UNWIND keys(langs) AS language
WITH language, langs[language] AS percentage, p
RETURN language, count(p) AS project_count, avg(percentage) AS avg_percentage
ORDER BY project_count DESC
```

**Note:** The `CONTAINS` query does a string search and works without APOC. For more precise queries (like filtering by percentage), use `apoc.convert.fromJsonMap()` to parse the JSON.

#### Relationships

- GitLabProjects belong to GitLabOrganizations.

    ```
    (GitLabOrganization)-[RESOURCE]->(GitLabProject)
    ```

    ```

- GitLabUsers can be members of GitLabProjects with different access levels.

    ```
    (GitLabUser)-[MEMBER_OF{role, access_level}]->(GitLabProject)
    ```

    The `role` property can be: owner, maintainer, developer, reporter, guest.
    The `access_level` property corresponds to GitLab's numeric levels: 50, 40, 30, 20, 10.

- GitLabUsers who have committed to GitLabProjects are tracked with commit activity data.

    ```
    (GitLabUser)-[COMMITTED_TO]->(GitLabProject)
    ```
