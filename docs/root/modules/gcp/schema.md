### GCPRole

Representation of a GCP [Role](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/reference/rest/v1/organizations.roles).

- **Custom project roles** (`projects/*/roles/*`) - Custom roles defined at the project level

**Important**: Organization-level roles (predefined + custom org) and project-level roles (custom project) have different sub-resource relationships:
