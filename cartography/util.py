    Decorator to handle AWS regional access errors and opt-in region limitations.

    This decorator wraps AWS API functions to gracefully handle client errors
    that occur when accessing regions that are disabled, require opt-in, or
    where the account lacks necessary permissions. Instead of failing, the
    decorated function returns an empty list when these specific errors occur.

    The decorator also includes exponential backoff retry logic to handle
    AWS TooManyRequestsException and other transient errors that may occur
    during API calls.

    Args:
        func: An AWS API function that returns an iterable (typically a list)
              of resources. Should be a 'get_' function that queries AWS services.

    Returns:
        The decorated function with error handling and retry logic applied.
        On handled errors, returns an empty list instead of raising exceptions.

    Examples:
        Decorating an AWS resource getter function:
        >>> @aws_handle_regions
        ... def get_ec2_instances(boto3_session, region):
        ...     ec2 = boto3_session.client('ec2', region_name=region)
        ...     return ec2.describe_instances()['Reservations']

    Note:
        The decorator handles these specific AWS error codes:
        - AccessDenied / AccessDeniedException
        - AuthFailure
        - AuthorizationError / AuthorizationErrorException
        - InvalidClientTokenId
        - UnauthorizedOperation
        - UnrecognizedClientException
        - InternalServerErrorException

        For these errors, a warning is logged and an empty list is returned.
        Other errors are re-raised normally.

        The decorator includes retry logic with exponential backoff (max 600 seconds)
        for handling transient AWS API errors and rate limiting.

        This should be used on functions that return lists of AWS resources
        and need to work across multiple regions, including those that may
        be disabled or require special permissions.

        max_tries: Maximum number of attempts before giving up. Includes the
                  initial attempt, so max_tries=3 means 1 initial + 2 retries.
        on_backoff: Callback function called before each retry attempt. Should
                   accept a dictionary with backoff details (wait, tries, target).

    Returns:
        The decorated function with retry logic applied. Preserves the original
        function's signature and return type.

    Examples:

        better readability and native time operations support.

    This utility function retrieves a datetime object from a dictionary
    and converts it to a Unix epoch timestamp (seconds since 1970-01-01).
    This is useful for standardizing date representations in Neo4j.

    Args:
        obj: The dictionary containing the date value.
        key: The key to look up in the dictionary.

    Returns:

        AWS API responses that return datetime objects for timestamps.

        Neo4j natively supports datetime objects and provides rich temporal
        functions for queries. Using datetime objects directly is preferred
        over epoch timestamps for better readability, timezone support, and
        access to Neo4j's temporal functions like date(), time(), and duration().

    Args:
        items: The iterable to split into batches.
        size: The maximum size of each batch. Defaults to DEFAULT_BATCH_SIZE.

    Yields:

        provided. If any awaitable raises an exception, the entire operation fails.

    Examples:

        - Testing async code in synchronous test frameworks
        - CLI scripts that need to orchestrate async operations

        For error handling, consider using asyncio.gather(return_exceptions=True)
