### KeycloakAuthenticationFlow

Represents an authentication flow in Keycloak that defines the sequence of authentication steps and requirements for user authentication. Authentication flows control how users authenticate to the realm and can include various authentication mechanisms and requirements.

```{important}
Only `root` flows are modeled as a `KeycloakAuthenticationFlow`. In Keycloak, there’s also the concept of a `subflow`, which is tied one-to-one to an Execution. For simplicity in Cartography, these subflows are represented solely by a `KeycloakAuthenticationExecution` node. However, the subflow ID is still preserved as a field on the node.
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| firstseen| Timestamp of when a sync job first created this node  |
| lastupdated |  Timestamp of the last time the node was updated |
| id | The unique identifier of the authentication flow |
| alias | The alias of the authentication flow (indexed for queries) |
| description | The description of the authentication flow |
| provider_id | The provider identifier for the authentication flow |
| top_level | Whether this is a top-level authentication flow |
| built_in | Whether this is a built-in authentication flow |
| realm | The realm name for flow lookup (indexed) |

#### Relationships
- `KeycloakAuthenticationFlow` belongs to a `KeycloakRealm`
    ```
    (:KeycloakAuthenticationFlow)<-[:RESOURCE]-(:KeycloakRealm)
    ```
- `KeycloakAuthenticationFlow` has authentication execution steps
    ```
    (:KeycloakAuthenticationFlow)-[:HAS_STEP]->(:KeycloakAuthenticationExecution)
    ```
- `KeycloakAuthenticationFlow` is the starting point of an autentication flow
    ```
    (:KeycloakAuthenticationFlow)-[:NEXT_STEP]->(:KeycloakAuthenticationExecution)
    ```
- `KeycloakClient` uses `KeycloakAuthenticationFlow`
    ```
    (:KeycloakClient)-[:USES]->(:KeycloakAuthenticationFlow)
    ```

```{important}
Cartography uses two distinct relationship types between Flows and Executions:

* `HAS_STEP` is used to describe the composition as defined in Keycloak (e.g., a subflow will be linked to its two REQUIRED executions).
* `NEXT_STEP` is used to describe the possible authentication flows. These are relationships inferred by Cartography (e.g., the subflow will only be connected to the first REQUIRED execution, which will in turn be connected to the third).
```

```mermaid
graph LR
F(KeycloakAuthenticationFlow) -- HAS_STEP --> E1(KeycloakAuthetiationExecution::REQUIRED_1)
F -- HAS_STEP --> E2(KeycloakAuthetiationExecution::REQUIRED_2)
F == NEXT_STEP ==> E1 == NEXT_STEP ==> E2
```

### KeycloakAuthenticationExecution

Represents an individual authentication execution step within a Keycloak authentication flow. Authentication executions define specific authentication mechanisms, requirements, and their order within an authentication flow.

| Field | Description |

| lastupdated |  Timestamp of the last time the node was updated |
| id | The unique identifier of the authentication execution |

| is_terminal_step | Flag to indicate if the Execution can be a terminal step in the workflow execution (this is infered by Cartography) |

#### Relationships

    ```
    (:KeycloakAuthenticationExecution)<-[:RESOURCE]-(:KeycloakRealm)
    ```
- `KeycloakAuthenticationExecution` is a part of an `KeycloakAuthenticationFlow`
