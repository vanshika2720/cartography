### ECRRepositoryImage

An ECR image may be referenced and tagged by more than one ECR Repository. To best represent this, we've created an
`ECRRepositoryImage` node as a layer of indirection between the repo and the image.

More concretely explained, we run
[`ecr.list_images()`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/APIReference/API_ImageIdentifier.html), and then
store the image tag on an `ECRRepositoryImage` node and the image digest hash on a separate `ECRImage` node.

This way, more than one `ECRRepositoryImage` can reference/be connected to the same `ECRImage`.

| Field | Description |
|--------|-----------|
| tag | The tag applied to the repository image, e.g. "latest" |
| uri | The URI where the repository image is stored |
| **id** | same as uri |
| image_size_bytes | The size of the image in bytes |
| image_pushed_at | The date and time the image was pushed to the repository |
| image_manifest_media_type | The media type of the image manifest, see [opencontainers image spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/media-types.md) |
| artifact_media_type | The media type of the image artifact |
| last_recorded_pull_time | The date and time the image was last pulled |

#### Relationships

- An ECRRepository contains ECRRepositoryImages:
    ```
    (:ECRRepository)-[:REPO_IMAGE]->(:ECRRepositoryImage)
    ```

- ECRRepositoryImages reference ECRImages
    ```
    (:ECRRepositoryImage)-[:IMAGE]->(:ECRImage)
    ```


### ECRImage

Representation of an ECR image identified by its digest (e.g. a SHA hash). Specifically, this is the "digest part" of
[`ecr.list_images()`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/APIReference/API_ImageIdentifier.html). Also see
ECRRepositoryImage.

For multi-architecture images, Cartography creates ECRImage nodes for the manifest list, each platform-specific image, and any attestations.

| Field | Description |
|--------|-----------|
| firstseen | Timestamp of when a sync job first discovered this node |
| lastupdated | Timestamp of the last time the node was updated |
| **id** | Same as digest |
| **digest** | The hash of this ECR image |
| region | The AWS region |
| layer_diff_ids | Ordered list of image layer digests for this image. Only set for `type="image"` nodes. `null` for manifest lists and attestations. |
| type | Type of image: `"image"` (platform-specific or single-arch image), `"manifest_list"` (multi-arch index), or `"attestation"` (attestation manifest) |
| architecture | CPU architecture (e.g., `"amd64"`, `"arm64"`). Set to `"unknown"` for attestations, `null` for manifest lists. |
| os | Operating system (e.g., `"linux"`, `"windows"`). Set to `"unknown"` for attestations, `null` for manifest lists. |
| variant | Architecture variant (e.g., `"v8"` for ARM). Optional field. |
| attestation_type | For attestations only: the type of attestation (e.g., `"attestation-manifest"`). `null` for regular images. |
| attests_digest | For attestations only: the digest of the image this attestation is for. `null` for regular images. |
| media_type | The OCI/Docker media type of this manifest (e.g., `"application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json"`) |
| artifact_media_type | The artifact media type if this is an OCI artifact. Optional field. |
| child_image_digests | For manifest lists only: list of platform-specific image digests contained in this manifest list. Excludes attestations. `null` for regular images and attestations. |

    ```

- An ECRImage may be built from a parent ECRImage (derived from provenance attestations).
    ```
    (:ECRImage)-[:BUILT_FROM]->(:ECRImage)
    ```

    Relationship properties:
    - `parent_image_uri`: The package URI of the parent image from the attestation (e.g., `pkg:docker/account.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/repo@digest`)
    - `from_attestation`: Boolean flag indicating the relationship was derived from provenance attestation (always `true`)
    - `confidence`: Confidence level of the relationship (always `"explicit"` for attestation-based relationships)

- A manifest list ECRImage contains platform-specific ECRImages (only applies to `type="manifest_list"` nodes)
    ```
    (:ECRImage {type: "manifest_list"})-[:CONTAINS_IMAGE]->(:ECRImage {type: "image"})
    ```

    ```
    (:ECRImage {type: "attestation"})-[:ATTESTS]->(:ECRImage)
    ```


### ECRImageLayer

Representation of an individual Docker image layer discovered while processing ECR manifests. Layers are de-duplicated by `diff_id`, so multiple images (or multiple points within the same image) may reference the same `ECRImageLayer` node. Note that `diff_id` is the **uncompressed** (DiffID) SHA-256 of the layer tar stream. Docker’s canonical empty layer therefore always appears as `sha256:5f70bf18a086007016e948b04aed3b82103a36bea41755b6cddfaf10ace3c6ef` and is marked with `is_empty = true`. (If you inspect registry manifests you may see the compressed blob digest `sha256:a3ed95ca...`, both refer to the same empty layer.)

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **id** | Same as `diff_id` |
| diff_id | Digest of the layer |
| lastupdated | Timestamp of the last time the node was updated |
| is_empty | Boolean flag identifying Docker's empty layer (true when the **DiffID** is `sha256:5f70bf18...`). |

#### Relationships

- Image layers belong to an AWSAccount
    ```
    (:ECRImageLayer)<-[:RESOURCE]-(:AWSAccount)
    ```

- Layers point to the next layer in the manifest
    ```
    (:ECRImageLayer)-[:NEXT]->(:ECRImageLayer)
    ```

- A layer can be the head of a platform-specific image (only `type="image"` nodes have layer relationships)
    ```
    (:ECRImage {type: "image"})-[:HEAD]->(:ECRImageLayer)
    ```

- A layer can be the tail of a platform-specific image
    ```
    (:ECRImage {type: "image"})-[:TAIL]->(:ECRImageLayer)
    ```

- Platform-specific images reference all of their layers
    ```
    (:ECRImage {type: "image"})-[:HAS_LAYER]->(:ECRImageLayer)
    ```

#### Query Examples

- List the ordered layers for a specific image directly from graph relationships:
    ```cypher
    MATCH (img:ECRImage {digest: $digest})-[:HEAD]->(head:ECRImageLayer)
    MATCH (img)-[:TAIL]->(tail:ECRImageLayer)
    MATCH path = (head)-[:NEXT*0..]->(tail)
    WHERE ALL(layer IN nodes(path) WHERE (img)-[:HAS_LAYER]->(layer))
    WITH path
    ORDER BY length(path) DESC
    LIMIT 1
    UNWIND range(0, length(path)) AS idx
    RETURN idx AS position, nodes(path)[idx].diff_id AS diff_id
    ORDER BY position;
    ```

- Use the stored manifest order when you only need the digests:
    ```cypher
    MATCH (img:ECRImage {digest: $digest})
    UNWIND range(0, size(img.layer_diff_ids) - 1) AS idx
    RETURN idx AS position, img.layer_diff_ids[idx] AS diff_id
    ORDER BY position;
    ```

- Detect images whose layer chains diverge (typically because the Docker empty layer is repeated):
    ```cypher
    MATCH (img:ECRImage)-[:HAS_LAYER]->(layer:ECRImageLayer)
    MATCH (layer)-[:NEXT]->(child:ECRImageLayer)
    WHERE (img)-[:HAS_LAYER]->(child)
    WITH img, layer, collect(DISTINCT child.diff_id) AS next_diff_ids
    WHERE size(next_diff_ids) > 1
    RETURN img.digest AS digest,
           layer.diff_id AS branching_layer,
           next_diff_ids AS successors
    ORDER BY digest, branching_layer;
    ```
- Find parent image given a digest (need to specify base image repository):
    ```cypher
    WITH $target_digest as target_digest
    // Get target image's layer chain via graph traversal
    MATCH (target:ECRImage {digest: target_digest})
    MATCH (target)-[:HAS_LAYER]->(tl:ECRImageLayer)
    WITH target, collect(id(tl)) AS targetAllowedIds
    CALL {
    WITH target, targetAllowedIds
    MATCH p = (target)-[:HEAD]->(:ECRImageLayer)-[:NEXT*0..]->(:ECRImageLayer)<-[:TAIL]-(target)
    WITH p, targetAllowedIds, [n IN nodes(p) WHERE n:ECRImageLayer | id(n)] AS layerIds
    WHERE all(i IN layerIds WHERE i IN targetAllowedIds)
    RETURN [n IN nodes(p) WHERE n:ECRImageLayer | n.diff_id] AS target_diff_ids
    ORDER BY length(p) DESC
    LIMIT 1
    }
    // Get all base images with their layer chains from a repo called 'base-images'
    MATCH (base_repo:ECRRepository {name: 'base-images'})-[:REPO_IMAGE]->(base_img:ECRRepositoryImage)-[:IMAGE]->(base:ECRImage)
    MATCH (base)-[:HAS_LAYER]->(bl:ECRImageLayer)
    WITH target_diff_ids, base, base_img, collect(id(bl)) AS baseAllowedIds
    CALL {
    WITH base, baseAllowedIds
    MATCH p = (base)-[:HEAD]->(:ECRImageLayer)-[:NEXT*0..]->(:ECRImageLayer)<-[:TAIL]-(base)
    WITH p, baseAllowedIds, [n IN nodes(p) WHERE n:ECRImageLayer | id(n)] AS layerIds
    WHERE all(i IN layerIds WHERE i IN baseAllowedIds)
    RETURN [n IN nodes(p) WHERE n:ECRImageLayer | n.diff_id] AS base_diff_ids
    ORDER BY length(p) DESC
    LIMIT 1
    }
    // Calculate longest common prefix
    WITH target_diff_ids, base, base_img, base_diff_ids,
        REDUCE(lcp = 0, i IN RANGE(0, SIZE(base_diff_ids)-1) |
        CASE WHEN i < SIZE(target_diff_ids) AND base_diff_ids[i] = target_diff_ids[i]
                THEN lcp + 1 ELSE lcp END
        ) as lcp_length
    // Only keep matches where ALL base layers match (complete prefix)
    WHERE lcp_length = SIZE(base_diff_ids)
    RETURN base.digest, base_img.uri, base_img.tag, base_img.image_pushed_at,
        SIZE(base_diff_ids) as base_layer_count, lcp_length
    ORDER BY lcp_length DESC, base_img.image_pushed_at DESC
    LIMIT 1
    ```

- Find all platform-specific images in a multi-architecture manifest list:
    ```cypher
    MATCH (manifest_list:ECRImage {type: "manifest_list"})-[:CONTAINS_IMAGE]->(platform_image:ECRImage)
    RETURN platform_image.architecture, platform_image.os, platform_image.variant, platform_image.digest
    ORDER BY platform_image.architecture;
    ```

- Find which image an attestation validates:
    ```cypher
    MATCH (attestation:ECRImage {type: "attestation"})-[:ATTESTS]->(image:ECRImage)
    RETURN attestation.digest AS attestation_digest, image.digest AS validated_image_digest;
    ```

- Find all attestations for a specific image:
    ```cypher
    MATCH (attestation:ECRImage {type: "attestation"})-[:ATTESTS]->(image:ECRImage {digest: $digest})
    RETURN attestation.digest, attestation.attestation_type;

| lastupdated |  Timestamp of the last time the node was updated |
| **id** | The ID of the network interface.  (known as `networkInterfaceId` in EC2) |

| status | Status of the network interface.  Valid Values: ``available \| associated \| attaching \| in-use \| detaching `` |
| **subnetid** | The ID of the subnet |
| **subnet_id** | The ID of the subnet |
| interface_type  |  Describes the type of network interface. Valid values: `` interface \| efa `` |
| **requester_id**  | Id of the requester, e.g. `amazon-elb` for ELBs |
| requester_managed  |  Indicates whether the interface is managed by the requester |
| source_dest_check   | Indicates whether to validate network traffic to or from this network interface.  |
| **public_ip**   | Public IPv4 address attached to the interface  |

| device_index | The index of the device on the instance for the network interface attachment. A value of `0` indicates the primary (eth0) network interface, which is created when the instance is launched. |

#### Usage Notes

**Finding the True First Launch Time:**

The `LaunchTime` field on EC2Instance nodes shows the *last* launch time (e.g., if an instance was stopped and restarted). To find when an instance was *originally* created, use the `attach_time` of the primary network interface (`device_index: 0`):

```cypher
// Get the true first launch time for EC2 instances
MATCH (i:EC2Instance)-[:NETWORK_INTERFACE]->(ni:NetworkInterface {device_index: 0})
WHERE ni.attach_time IS NOT NULL
RETURN i.instanceid, i.launchtime as last_launch, ni.attach_time as first_launch
```

**Primary vs Secondary Interfaces:**
- **Primary interfaces** (`device_index: 0`): Created when the instance is launched, cannot be detached. The `attach_time` represents the instance's original creation time.
- **Secondary interfaces** (`device_index: 1+`): Can be attached and detached at any time. The `attach_time` represents when the secondary interface was attached, not when the instance was created.

#### Relationships

| **endpoint** | Specifies the connection endpoint for the primary instance of the DB cluster. |
| **reader\_endpoint** | The reader endpoint for the DB cluster. The reader endpoint for a DB cluster load-balances connections across the Aurora Replicas that are available in a DB cluster. As clients request new connections to the reader endpoint, Aurora distributes the connection requests among the Aurora Replicas in the DB cluster. This functionality can help balance your read workload across multiple Aurora Replicas in your DB cluster. If a failover occurs, and the Aurora Replica that you are connected to is promoted to be the primary instance, your connection is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to other Aurora Replicas in the cluster, you can then reconnect to the reader endpoint. |

Thus, if you restore a snapshot, SnapshotDatabaseTime is the most recent transaction in the restored DB instance. In contrast, originalSnapshotCreateTime specifies the system time that the snapshot completed. If you back up a read replica, you can determine the replica lag by comparing SnapshotDatabaseTime with originalSnapshotCreateTime. For example, if originalSnapshotCreateTime is two hours later than SnapshotDatabaseTime, then the replica lag is two hours. |

### AWSSSOUser

Representation of an AWS SSO User.

> **Ontology Mapping**: This node has the extra label `UserAccount` to enable cross-platform queries for user accounts across different systems (e.g., OktaUser, EntraUser, GitHubUser).

> **Cross-Platform Integration**: AWSSSOUser nodes can be federated with external identity providers like Okta, Entra (Azure AD), and others. See the complete Okta → AWS SSO → AWS Role relationship path documentation in the [Okta Schema](../okta/schema.md#cross-platform-integration-okta-to-aws).

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **id** | Unique identifier for the SSO user |
| firstseen | Timestamp of when a sync job first discovered this node |
| lastupdated | Timestamp of the last time the node was updated |
| user_name | The username of the SSO user |
| **external_id** | The external ID of the SSO user |
| identity_store_id | The identity store ID of the SSO user |
| region | The AWS region |

#### Relationships
- AWSSSOUser is part of an AWSAccount.
    ```
    (:AWSAccount)-[:RESOURCE]->(:AWSSSOUser)
    ```

- An AWSSSOUser can be a member of one or more AWSSSOGroups. In effect, the AWSSSOUser will receive all permission sets that the group is assigned to.
    ```
    (:AWSSSOUser)-[:MEMBER_OF_SSO_GROUP]->(:AWSSSOGroup)
    ```

- AWSSSOUsers can be assigned to AWSRoles. This happens when the user is assigned to a permission set for a specific account. This includes both direct assignments to the user and assignments inherited through AWSSSOGroup membership. Note: The AWS Identity Center API (`list_account_assignments_for_principal`) automatically resolves group memberships server-side, so users receive `ALLOWED_BY` relationships for roles they can access through groups they belong to.
    ```
    (:AWSSSOUser)<-[:ALLOWED_BY]-(:AWSRole)
    ```

- OktaUsers can assume AWS SSO users via SAML federation
     ```
    (:OktaUser)-[:CAN_ASSUME_IDENTITY]->(:AWSSSOUser)
    ```
    More generically, user accounts can assume AWS SSO users via SAML federation.
    ```
    (:UserAccount)-[:CAN_ASSUME_IDENTITY]->(:AWSSSOUser)
    ```

- An AWSSSOUser can be assigned to one or more AWSPermissionSets. This includes both direct assignments and assignments inherited through AWSSSOGroup membership.
    ```
    (:AWSSSOUser)-[:HAS_PERMISSION_SET]->(:AWSPermissionSet)
    ```
    Notes:
    - The AWS Identity Center API (`list_account_assignments_for_principal`) automatically resolves group memberships server-side, so users receive `HAS_PERMISSION_SET` relationships for permission sets they have access to through groups they belong to. This means if a user is only in a group that has a permission set assignment, the user will still have a direct `HAS_PERMISSION_SET` relationship to that permission set.
    - This is a **summary relationship** that does not indicate which specific accounts the user has access to, only that they have been assigned to the permission set. For a user to have access to an AWS account, they must be assigned to a permission set for that specific account. This is captured by the `ALLOWED_BY` relationship.

- AWSSSOUser can assume AWS roles via SAML (recorded from CloudTrail management events).
    ```
    (:AWSSSOUser)-[:ASSUMED_ROLE_WITH_SAML {times_used, first_seen_in_time_window, last_used, lastupdated}]->(:AWSRole)
    ```
    This relationship is created by analyzing CloudTrail `AssumeRoleWithSAML` events. The relationship properties track:
    - `times_used`: Number of times the role was assumed during the lookback window
    - `first_seen_in_time_window`: Earliest assumption time in the lookback window
    - `last_used`: Most recent assumption time
    - `lastupdated`: When this relationship was last updated by Cartography

    Note: This relationship represents **actual role usage** (what roles were assumed), while `ALLOWED_BY` represents **permitted access** (what roles can be assumed based on permission set assignments).

- Entra users can sign on to AWSSSOUser via SAML federation through AWS Identity Center. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/idp-microsoft-entra.html and https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/saas-apps/aws-single-sign-on-tutorial.

- An AWSSSOGroup can have roles assigned. This happens if the group is assigned to a permission set for a specific account.
    ```
    (:AWSSSOGroup)<-[:ALLOWED_BY]-(:AWSRole)
    ```

- An AWSSSOGroup has assigned permission sets. AWSSSOUsers in the group will receive all permission sets that the group is assigned to.
    ```
    (:AWSSSOGroup)-[:HAS_PERMISSION_SET]->(:AWSPermissionSet)
    ```
    Notes:
    - This relationship does not indicate which accounts the group has access to, only that it has been assigned to the permission set. For a group to have access to an AWS account, it must be assigned to a permission set for that specific account. This is captured by the `ALLOWED_BY` relationship.
    - The AWS Identity Center API (`list_account_assignments_for_principal`) automatically resolves group memberships server-side, so users receive `HAS_PERMISSION_SET` relationships for permission sets they have access to through groups they belong to. This means if a user is only in a group that has a permission set assignment, the user will still have a direct `HAS_PERMISSION_SET` relationship to that permission set.

    ```

- An AWSPermissionSet creates AWSRoles in all of the AWS accounts that its associated permission set assigns it to.
    ```
    (:AWSPermissionSet)-[:ASSIGNED_TO_ROLE]->(:AWSRole)
    ```

- An AWSSSOUser can be assigned to one or more AWSPermissionSets. This includes both direct assignments and assignments inherited through AWSSSOGroup membership.
    ```
    (:AWSSSOUser)-[:HAS_PERMISSION_SET]->(:AWSPermissionSet)
    ```
    Notes:
    - The AWS Identity Center API (`list_account_assignments_for_principal`) automatically resolves group memberships server-side, so users receive `HAS_PERMISSION_SET` relationships for permission sets they have access to through groups they belong to. This means if a user is only in a group that has a permission set assignment, the user will still have a direct `HAS_PERMISSION_SET` relationship to that permission set.
    - This is a **summary relationship** that does not indicate which specific accounts the user has access to, only that they have been assigned to the permission set. For a user to have access to an AWS account, they must be assigned to a permission set _for that specific account_. This is captured by the `ALLOWED_BY` relationship.

- An AWSSSOGroup has assigned permission sets. AWSSSOUsers in the group will receive all permission sets that the group is assigned to.
    ```
    (:AWSSSOGroup)-[:HAS_PERMISSION_SET]->(:AWSPermissionSet)
    ```
    Note: This relationship does not indicate which accounts the group has access to, only that it has been assigned to the permission set. For a group to have access to an AWS account, it must be assigned to a permission set for that specific account. This is captured by the `ALLOWED_BY` relationship.
